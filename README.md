Python data exploration 
Python is a requirement (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7) for installing the Jupyter Notebook itself.
Install Jupiter through anaconda or PIP

The key steps involved in Data Science Modelling are: 
Step 1: Understanding the Problem
Step 2: Data Extraction 
Step 3: Data Cleaning
Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis
Step 5: Feature Selection
Step 6: Incorporating Machine Learning Algorithms
Step 7: Testing the Models 
Step 8: Deploying the Model

Exploratory Data Analysis ?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a method used to analyze and summarize datasets. Majority of the EDA techniques involve the use of graphs.
It is a robust technique for familiarising yourself with Data and extracting useful insights. Data Scientists sift through Unstructured Data to find patterns and infer relationships between Data elements. Data Scientists use Statistics and Visualisation tools to summarise Central Measurements and variability to perform EDA.
If Data skewness persists, appropriate transformations are used to scale the distribution around its mean. When Datasets have a lot of features, exploring them can be difficult. As a result, to reduce the complexity of Model inputs, Feature Selection is used to rank them in order of significance in Model Building for enhanced efficiency. Using Business Intelligence tools like Tableau, MicroStrategy, etc. can be quite beneficial in this step. This step is crucial in Data Science Modelling as the Metrics are studied carefully for validation of Data Outcomes.

PyGWalker
Tableau has been the go-to tool for this purpose, but it comes with a significant cost. Fortunately, PyGWalker, a Python library that can turn your pandas dataframe into a Tableau-style user interface, is an open-source alternative to Tableau.
